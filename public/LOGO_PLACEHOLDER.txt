LOGO PLACEHOLDER
================

Replace the mosaic-logo.png file with the actual Mosaic Corporation logo.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Dimensions: 600x160 pixels (or similar ratio)
- File size: < 100KB
- High resolution for retina displays

You can download the official Mosaic logo from:
https://mosaiccorp.com

Once you have the logo:
1. Delete mosaic-logo.png
2. Add your logo as mosaic-logo.png in this /public directory
3. Delete this LOGO_PLACEHOLDER.txt file

The logo will appear:
- In the microsite header
- On the landing page
- In the dashboard

For now, the system will gracefully handle the missing logo by hiding the image element.
